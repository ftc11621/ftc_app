For Mac OS:
1. If you get the following message when using adb:
        "adb command not found"
        using terminal to edit ~/.bash_profile file
        add the following line (example, change the SDK path if different):
            export PATH="/Users/myuser/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools":$PATH
